# create-description

The code prepares and preprocesses data from a CSV file to create a dataset for a text generation task, specifically generating product names and descriptions based on categories. It then tokenizes the text data using the Hugging Face Transformers library and fine-tunes a causal language model with a LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) module to reduce the number of trainable parameters while maintaining performance. Finally, it trains the model using the Trainer class from the Hugging Face Transformers library and evaluates its performance on the test dataset.
